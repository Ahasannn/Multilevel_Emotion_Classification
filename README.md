# Brief Description

In this project, we have classified emotions from texts. Emotions considered in this work are Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, Admiration, Surprise, Interest, Fear. We have collected our text data from twitter. We have used two algorithm adaptations methods to work with multiple labels. One is Multi-label K nearest neighbors (MLkNN) and another one combines approaches from both Binary Relevance and K-Nearest neighbor (BRkNN).
